# ZenSolar Phased Fundraising & Token Release Model

## Executive Summary

This document outlines ZenSolar's fundraising strategy from Pre-seed through Series C, mapping liquidity pool depth, circulating token supply, user milestones, revenue projections, and token price targets at each stage. The core thesis: ZenSolar is **permanent clean energy financial infrastructure** — the locked liquidity pool replaces the federal government's role in incentivizing clean energy adoption.

---

## Guiding Principles

1. **Managed Supply Curve:** The 10B token supply is released strategically to match real user demand, not dumped at launch.
2. **LP-First Fundraising:** A significant portion of each raise goes directly into locked liquidity, not just operations.
3. **Revenue-Backed Floor:** 50% of all subscription revenue continuously deepens the LP beyond the locked base.
4. **Deflationary Pressure:** 20% mint burn + 7% transfer tax ensures circulating supply grows slower than user adoption.

## Cumulative Revenue & Cash Position

| Phase | Cumulative Revenue | Revenue to LP (50%) | Operational Cash |
|-------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Pre-seed | $0 | $0 | Founder capital |
| Seed (18 mo) | $180,000 | $90,000 | ~$700K remaining |
| Series A (36 mo) | $5.5M | $2.75M | ~$6M remaining |
| Series B (60 mo) | $60M | $30M | ~$25M remaining |
| Series C (120 mo) | $750M | $375M | Revenue-funded |

**Key Insight:** By Series B, subscription revenue alone injects $2.5M/month into LP. By Year 10, it's $20M/month. The locked base becomes a small fraction of total LP depth — the flywheel takes over.

## The Infrastructure Narrative

At each fundraising stage, the pitch evolves:

- **Seed:** "We've proven the technology works. We're locking $1.5M to build the foundation."
- **Series A:** "We have 5,000 users generating real revenue. We're locking $7.5M total to make this permanent infrastructure."
- **Series B:** "We're at $10M ARR with 50K users. The $25M locked LP makes this price floor essentially unbreakable."
- **Series C:** "We're replacing federal tax credits for millions of Americans. The $50M+ locked LP is the financial backbone of the clean energy transition."
